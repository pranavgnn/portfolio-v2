      <p>
        Currently a 2nd year BTech student at Manipal Institute of Technology,
        pursuing an integrated masters in entrepreneurship. I'm based in
        Manipal, India, where I'm constantly exploring the intersection of
        technology and business.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a fullstack developer, I enjoy creating seamless user experiences
        with responsive frontend designs and robust backend systems. I'm also
        pretty good with automation and web scraping, taking the boring work out
        of everyday tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me brainstorming startup ideas or
        learning something new - I'm always up for a challenge!
